## My process

Utilized design images (no figma files) and started with mobile first approach. Utilized mac preview to try and approximate
specific heights and widths for elements as needed.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One new thing I learned to do during this project was utilizing text-wrap: balance to get the text to wrap onto lines in a more
balanced way, which happened to make the text match the design as well. Also instead of thinking desktop first, I worked through this project
from a mobile first approach, which did provide give a different perspective to how I have originally done things. I will continue to hone this
approach as I progress.
